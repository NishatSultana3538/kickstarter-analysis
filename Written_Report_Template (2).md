# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Kickstarter data to help Louise with her project campaign

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset I am trying to  visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
First I create the formula for all different goal categories for number "successful" , then I copied it to number "failed" and number "canceled" and change the "successful" into "failed" and 
"canceled". I get 0 output for all canceled colum. So i was confused and later cheked and find that there is no canceled outcome for "Plays" catgory.I  use Sum formula to get total project. Then I use percentage formula with rounding to get percentage successful , failed and canceled. To make the cells out come to % I have to divide by 100 to convert it to deccimal and then format cells to use %.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I first face challenge to filter the parent catagory into Theater. The parent catagory was only showing "Film & video" as options.![image_image1](/Users/nishatsultana/Desktop/classwork/Challenge1/to/image_image1.png)   my Excel file was corrupted and I started from a new file then it worke. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The highest successful outcomes happen in the month of May and then it gradually decreases towards fall .
2. Number of Successful out come is alaways more than failed outcome . 



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The goal range doesnt clearly related to the successfull outcome.
2. The canceled outcome is 0% through all ranges for Plays catagory.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

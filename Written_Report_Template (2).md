# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
First I create the formula for all different goal categories for number "successful" , then I copied it to number "failed" and number "canceled" and change the "successful" into "failed" and 
"canceled". I get 0 output for all canceled colum. So i was confused and later cheked and find that there is no canceled outcome for "Plays" catgory.I  use Sum formula to get total project. Then I use percentage formula with rounding to get percentage successful , failed and canceled. To make the cells out come to % I have to divide by 100 to convert it to deccimal and then format cells to use %.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I first face challenge to filter the parent catagory into Theater.![image_name]

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.The highest successful outcomes happen in the month of May and then it gradually decreases towards fall .
2. Number of Successful out come is alaways more than failed outcome . 



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The goal rage doesnt clearly related to the successfull outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
